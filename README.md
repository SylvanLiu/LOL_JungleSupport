# League of Legends Voice Assistance (Jungling)

## This program is extremely different from the cheating tools hence won't cause your accounts being banned; it won't read and write your game memory. Instead, it only helps new junglers optimizing their timetable, for a better on-lanes and off-lanes profit, while you need to farm and gank at the same time.

#### Noticed: the jungling system had been changed since v8.10, from 2018-05-21. This voice assistance is designed for current versions(10.8 and 10.9)

#### As you are using the Mac OS, you need to the 'Accessibility' --> 'Speech' --> 'System voice' and choose an appropriate language (English or Chinese) and scheme for this voice assistance script.

Launch the python script for each game:

Press F8 while you are allowed to leave the Spawn (at 15 seconds after the very beginning.)

Press F1 to record that you have killed the red buff

Press F2 to record that you have killed the blue buff

Press F3 to record that you have killed the crab which at the river of red buff side.

Press F4 to record that you have killed the crab which at the river of blue buff side.

Press F5 to record that you have killed the dragon

Press F6 to record that you have killed the pioneer

Press Del to exit this program

You need to press the corresponding key to record that what you just did (what mob has been killed), and it will notify you for the coming of the next one.

It will send you voice notifications while there is/are one/two minute(s) before some mobs appearing, and also while some mobs have refreshed.
It will also notify you while there is/are one/two minute(s) before top/mid and bot laners get level-6 (Which means it will be more difficult for you to gank at that lane)

Furthur plan:
1. Involving speech detecting technology, for simpler telling the assistance your current jungling plan.
2. Considering the ult skills and summoner spells and send an appropriate notification to the user.
3. Expand its function to the other three laners.

### Console example:

<'Run'>jungling assistance has launched, may you have a pentakill

<'F8'>items list has been refreshed ['red buff', 'blue buff', 'red crab', 'blue crab', 'dragon', 'mid get 6', 'top get 6', 'bot get 6', 'pioneer']

There is only one minute before red buff

There is only one minute before blue buff

There are still two minutes before red crab

There are still two minutes before blue crab

red buff has appeared

blue buff has appeared

<'F1'>items list has been refreshed ['blue buff', 'red crab', 'blue crab', 'dragon', 'mid get 6', 'top get 6', 'red buff', 'bot get 6', 'pioneer']

<'F2'>items list has been refreshed ['red crab', 'blue crab', 'dragon', 'mid get 6', 'top get 6', 'red buff', 'blue buff', 'bot get 6', 'pioneer']

<'Del'>jungling assistance has terminated

#### P.S. There will only be the artificial error while you record things by pressing keys, all threadings and processed are accurate and will rarely influence your game performance.
