# LOL_VoiceAssistance

## This program is different from those cheating tools, it won't read and write your game memory. Instead, it only helps new junglers optimizing their timetable, for a better on-lanes and off-lanes profit, while you need to farm and gank at the same time.

Noticed: the jungling system had been changed since v8.10, from 2018-05-21.
